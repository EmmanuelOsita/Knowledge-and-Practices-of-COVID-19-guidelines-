## Project Overview

The project was to assess the knowledge and practices of COVID-19 guidelines among persons with hearing impairment in the villages in Pankshin, Pleateau State, Nigeria. By studying that, it will identify gaps in awareness, ensure effective public health interventins and promote inclusive measures to safegaurd this vulnerable population in case of other pandemics and epidemics that may arise in the futureThe study will be used to guide health practitioners on the health promotion and disease prevention programs in times of the COVID-19 or other pandemics and epidemics that may arise in the future.

## Source of Data

The primary source of the data used for this project was surveys and interviews conducted with persons with hearing impairment.

## Tools

- Excel (Used for Data Cleaning)[https://microsoft.com]
- SPSS (Used for Creating a report) [https://spss.en.softonic.com/]

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

1. Data Valdation: Ensured completeness by checking for missing or inconsistent entries
2. Data Correction: Corrected errors such as inacurate or duplicated responses
3. Handling Missing Data: Removed incomplete responses
4. Data set review: Verified the data set for accuracy before analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

To what extent are persons with hearing impairment aware of the COVID-19 guidlines
To what extent do persons with hearing impairment practice COVID-19 guidlines

## Summary of Findings

1. Persons with hearing impairment showed limited awareness of COVID-19 guidlines. Communication barriers such as inadequate sign language intepreters and lack of accessible information contributed to this gap.
2. Persons with hearing impairment struggled to practice COVID-10 guidlines consistently due to challenges in accessing protective measures like masks, sanitizers and social distancing.

## Recommendations

1. COVID-19 guidlines should be developed in accessible formats including sign language videos
3. Tere should be increase in the availability of sign language intepreters in healthcare settings and public awareness.

## Limitations
1. Communication challenges may have led to incomplete or misintepreted responses duirng surveys and interview.
2. Movement restriction during the pandemic may have impacted the ability to reach a larger population of persons with hearing impairment.
